# Decorator
Decorators - profile_count(recursive=XX) and profile_time decorators. Apply it on fibonacci function and show us that it works as expected for<br/>
    1. a single top level call with recursive=True, (say fib (8)<br/>
    2. for multiple top level calls in a for loop.say fib(8) called 5 times
